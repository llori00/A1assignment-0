<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Jordan Ngo, you can call me Jordan. I was born in Carlton, Victoria but my background is that of Vietnamese and a little bit of Chinese. I speak english predominantly at home but I can kind of converse in Vietnamese with limited vocabulary; as for Chinese, my parents speak both English and Chinese with Vietnamese being their main language. Although I am buddist, my family is pretty loosely attached to the religion and many of my cousins practice other religions. As for my education so far. I have attended Altona Meadows Primary School from years prep to grade 3. Then transferring to Carranballac College in the boardwalk campus for grade 4 till 9. Finally, finishing the rest of my years in Point Cook Senior Secondary College enrolled into the ATAR system, which takes us to where I am now. Currently in my first year studying at RMIT, enrolled in the Bachelors of Information Technology.

A little bit more about myself, my favourite sport is soccer or football, with no team that I support in particular, but my favourite player would be Lionel Messi. I used to play soccer for a local team, the Point Cook Jets from under 11’s to under 17’s, prompted by my dad who is a football fanatic and had me play it since I was very young. Although I do not have any pets, I would love to have a pet cat, like any cat. I like drawing in an anime art style and riding fixies. Other than that I love gaming and talking to people.

My interest in Information Technology started from my early introduction to computers and games from my dad’s laptop, where I started to play Counter Strike 1.6 and play around with windows and computers in general. I had soon grown up and more into games and finally built my own computer in 2015, with my record now sitting at 6 computers built, it has become really fun and after all the troubleshooting that usually happens, the outcome is really satisfying. As for more of an IT topic neural networks have my interest right now, as my introduction to it was from small projects made by some youtubers which had gained my attention, wanting to know how it works and all. Micheal Reeves was my introduction to it as he used neural networks in his projects for pattern recognition and targeting certain objects. Where also memes had influenced and gave me more interest into the topic such as deep fakes.

I chose RMIT because it has technology in its name and because of its popularity. Not only is it fairly simple for me to travel there, also known as being the most convenient, I get to explore the city as it is basically integrated into Melbourne Central. Looking at the program structure ahead of time I saw that there were a few options that I was interested in, where I had time to decide after touching on the different subjects in the first year. When coming to RMIT I expected the classes to be a bit more advance in the topics that we are learning, as I had done a classes in year 11 and 12 on software development, but also stuff that was more relevant on actual usage and professional practice as in year 11 and 12 the content was more of an introduction with hobby like intentions over actual potential usage.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<p>My ideal job would be a network architect, looking at a network architect job at Mastercard. 
Network Architect - O'Fallon, MO 63368 - Indeed.com
Network Architect (myworkdayjobs.com)
The position of Network Architect for Mastercard is a position that is made up of many qualities and essentially the position requires that the person in the position must practically implement network infrastructures, which includes designing the network and its architecture. During this there must be implementation of network security and automation as the network also has to be Data Centre centric due to the requirements and size of the company. The role requires the employee to have experience in analysing and testing high and low level designs as well as innovate in the implementation. Being a network architect also requires comewho can work within teams as the scale of the operations will be quite literally global, which will require all collaborators and such to work together efficiently. The employee needs to have worked with cloud computing and API’s previously as mistakes can be fatal. Usually, the requirements needed to be considered a network architect is a bachelors in a computer related field, such as computer science, information technology/systems and engineering. Other considerations that are taken are other qualifications such as business management, majors and minors in specific professions like, database or computer administrators. I currently am studying Information Technology in my first year and have experience with a little bit of SQL and Python as well as some experience with home networking. My path to securing the role would be to finish my studies going into the major of network programming and minor of international business, finding a job near the end of my second year within the field of data management or system administrator, to fully optimise my chances.</p>
